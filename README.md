# FlashParkMVP

1. Used services and dependency injection for CRUD operations
2. Used EF Core for ORM
3. Used EF Code First and seeder data in migrations
4. Used Task library and Async Await non blocking operations
5. Used BehaviorSubject observable for updating List on adding/removing vehicle (Other than easier commented approach which does not require big API call)
6. Used Primary,Foreign key in Models class
7. Used DTO class for rendering data on client side
8. Focused on SignalR for data sync across multiple users/browsers instead of unit tests (but no luck so far)
9. Added a sample MS unit test using MOQ library in test project
